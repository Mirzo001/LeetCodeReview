# LeetCodeReview
Hello and welcome to code review. There will be Software Engineers to test my coding ability. 
To help myself I read many contents to think firstly like a human, and then command to the computer. 
I also provide my roadmap and list of programs here: 

1. https://brilliant.org/    
Learn to think
Brilliant replaces lecture videos with hands-on, interactive lessons. Itâ€™s a better (and more fun) way to learn.

2. https://simpleprogrammer.com/
The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide. This book also very perfectly written. It helped to me to shape my soft skills.
